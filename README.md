## `<span>`

- The `<span>` tag is much like the `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element.

- The `<span>` tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

## `vh` & `vw`

`vh` stands for **viewport height** and `vw` is for **viewport width**. Hence, setting an element to a width value of `50vw` means that the element will have a
$\mathtt{width = 50\%*(the-viewport-size)}$
<br>
This stays true when the viewport is resized.
