## Concepts

### HUD: Heads-Up Display

> What is a HUD element?

> HUD elements could include a mini-map in the corner, a health bar, and a variety of other items to aid the player. The HUD is there to present the player with important information while not being distracting. A great example of a heads up display is in the Halo series.
